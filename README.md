# Creating-a-Area-Chart-for-the-US-Tech-Companies-Adopting-Dual-Class-Voting-Structures

The area chart is rendered by using a collection of line segments connected to form a closed loop area, filled with the specified color. To render a area chart, create an instance of [AreaSeries](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.AreaSeries.html?tabs=tabid-1) and add it to the [Series](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.SfCartesianChart.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_SfCartesianChart_Series) collection property of the chart.

> The cartesian chart has [Series](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.SfCartesianChart.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_SfCartesianChart_Series) as its default content.

This sample is used to visualize a dual-class voting structure using a .NET MAUI Area Chart.
